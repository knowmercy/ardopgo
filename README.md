Go implementation of the ardop TNC

This is in the very early stages of development. 

The goal of this projet are to have an open source TNC that runs on multiple platforms. Currently it is being developed using Pat as the winlink client and rigctld on a linux machine. 

This is a big project so please consider supporting us financially if possible. This is intended to better the ham radio community.
